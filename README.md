Snappy Cobra - Global Game Jam Game 2016: ScrappyRoba.

This repository holds the sources for our very first Global Game Jam Game: **ScrappyRoba**.
The game is a cross between a resource management game, base builder and the classic game of [Mastermind](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind).
It runs on the never before used Java based MOTOR engine ~~(which is as stable as you would expect for a single-student project)~~.

Check out the **ScrappyRoba_Unity** branch, it's a post-jam effort to port the game to [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and finish the basic gameplay.
