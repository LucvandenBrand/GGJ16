Snappy Cobra - Global Game Jam Game 2016: ScrappyRoba.

This repository holds the sources for our very first Global Game Jam Game: **ScrappyRoba**.
The game is a cross between a resource management game, base builder and the classic game of [Mastermind](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind).
It runs on the never before used Java based MOTOR engine ~~(which is not very good at all and should be forgotten)~~.
